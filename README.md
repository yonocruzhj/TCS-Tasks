<h2> Task 2: Design IAM solution </h2> <br/>
The purpose of this document is to propose IAM (Identity and Access Management) solutions for TechCorp Enterprises to address critical requirements identified during the readiness assessment. These requirements focus on two main areas: enhancing user lifecycle management and strengthening access control mechanisms. Our goal is to streamline TechCorp’s operations, boost security, and align with the company’s broader business objectives.

Overview of TechCorp’s Requirements

The readiness assessment identified several challenges:

User Lifecycle Management: TechCorp currently lacks a streamlined process for onboarding, updating, and offboarding users. This has led to security gaps where former employees still have access to internal systems and makes the company susceptible to insider threats

Access Control Mechanisms: The existing access control lacks robust enforcement for sensitive resources. There is a need for consistent authentication methods and fine-grained access controls implementing the principle of least privilege. 

IAM Solution Design

**User Lifecycle Management**

Solution:  
Our proposed solution for user lifecycle management includes automated provisioning, updating, and de-provisioning of users. We recommend implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which will assign users access rights based on predefined roles.  
Key stages include:

* Onboarding: Automate the provisioning of new users based on their department, job role, and location.  
* Role Management: Enable changes to permissions automatically when users change roles or departments.  
* Offboarding: Automate the de-provisioning of access rights when users leave the organization.

Technologies Utilized:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS): This solution integrates seamlessly with most existing environments, automating user provisioning/de-provisioning, and providing RBAC features that work well in cloud and hybrid environments.

Implementation Plan:

* Integration: Connect AWS IAM to HR and IT systems to trigger automatic updates based on HR or IT changes.  
* Workflow Configuration: Define workflows for user access requests, approvals, and audits.  
* Pilot then Rollout: Implement a phased rollout, starting with a pilot in one department, followed by full deployment.

**Strengthen Access Control Mechanisms**  
Solution:  
To strengthen TechCorp’s access control, we propose implementing RBAC as well as MFA. RBAC ensures users are granted access rights based on their role, implementing the principle of least privilege and reducing risk of privilege escalation. MFA will be required for users to strengthen the authentication process and make it harder for attackers to access sensitive data. 

Technologies Utilized:

* Okta: Provides SSO and access management features.  
* Duo Security: Provides MFA.

Implementation plan:

* To strengthen access control, we propose a combination of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Single Sign-On (SSO).   
* Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) can be applied for sensitive resources, requiring specific conditions to be met (e.g., location-based access). Access control policies will restrict user access based on attributes like location, device, and department.

Alignment with Business Processes

The proposed IAM solutions align seamlessly with TechCorp’s existing processes:

* Streamlining Simple Operations: Automating user lifecycle processes reduces manual work for HR and IT teams, ensuring that new users are promptly onboarded with the correct permissions and offboarded when they leave.  
* Improved Compliance: By automating role assignments and access audits, the IAM solution ensures compliance with company policies and industry regulations.  
* Ease of Access for Employees: With SSO, users can access multiple systems with a single login, improving productivity by reducing the need for multiple passwords and password resets.

Alignment with Business Objectives

These IAM solutions directly support TechCorp’s business objectives:

* Enhanced Security: MFA, SSO, and ABAC policies add multiple layers of protection, minimizing unauthorized access and safeguarding sensitive data.  
* Simplified User Experience: SSO improves convenience by allowing users to access multiple applications without re-authentication, reducing login fatigue.  
* Competitive Edge: By modernizing security and user access, TechCorp strengthens its reputation in the tech industry as a security-conscious organization, contributing to its competitive positioning.

Rationale for Selected Solutions

The chosen IAM solutions and approaches are based on best practices and TechCorp’s specific needs:

* AWS: integrates well with TechCorp’s IT infrastructure and provides RBAC features that are compatible in both cloud and hybrid environments which gives TechCorp incorporating cloud functions.  
* RBAC and ABAC: RBAC simplifies permissions management for common roles, while ABAC adds granularity to sensitive data access, protecting critical assets without compromising usability.  
* Okta and Duo for Access Control: Okta’s robust SSO and Duo’s MFA capabilities ensure that authentication is both secure and user-friendly.

Conclusion

The proposed IAM solutions for TechCorp are designed to enhance security, streamline operations, and align with business objectives. By implementing these solutions, TechCorp will achieve stronger user lifecycle management and access control, resulting in increased efficiency and protection of sensitive data, positioning the company as a leader in secure and efficient identity management. This document provides a clear path forward for TechCorp to implement IAM solutions that not only address immediate security concerns but also support long-term business growth, user accessibility, and security resilience.
